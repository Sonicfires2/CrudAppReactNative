To deploy,

FIRST, log into your expo account on your terminal

NOTE: 
- use 'eas whoami' to see if you are logged in or not 

SECOND, run 'eas init' to create a project based on your code into your eas account

THIRD, run 'eas build:configure' and then select 'All' or 'Android' or 'IOS' (there is some disadvantages to doing both Android and IOS immediately if you are starting out) 
Note: You need developer account fo Android and IOS. For Android, it isnt bullshit to get your app a build, however, for IOS, you gonna want a developer account for that
=> This will create a eas.config file for you

FOURTH: Go to .gitignore file, just in case if you CREATED A LOCAL BUILD for ANDROID AND/OR IOS
- put in /ios and /android into the .gitignore file. 
We have to do this cause if Expo see a ios or android folder in our directory, it wont make the build because it affraid that it might overwrite sth. 

FIFTH:
Run 'npx expo install --check' to check for dependencies
WARNINGS: If the require you to DOWNGRADE dependencies, DONT DO IT, unless complete neccesary.
You could always install the needed dependencies and then change the version of the package as needed.
You can get the latest version by doing:
'npm install [package-name]@latest'
NOTE: Rerun the application to make sure

SIXTH:
eas build --profile [build-type] --platform [platform-you-want-to-build]
install expo-dev-client if needed. 
NOTE: go to expo.dev dashboard to check progress 

SEVEN:
scan the QR code or use the URL to build and install the app. 

EIGHT:
Once app is installed, you can start the development server using 
npx expo start 
or
npx expo start --tunnel

There you go! You now have a native app working on a phone FOR DEVELOPMENT, NOT PRODUCTION
